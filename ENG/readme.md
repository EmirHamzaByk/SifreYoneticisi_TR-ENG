This code is a password manager that allows users to save, update and delete their passwords. The user can input a website, username and password, which will be saved in a text file called "passwords.txt". The user can also choose to update or delete a previously saved website password. The code uses an input-based menu system, where the user can select options such as "Save a password", "View saved passwords", "Update a password" and "Delete a password". If the user makes an invalid selection, the code will prompt "Invalid selection. Please select a number between 1-5.". This code can be named as "Password Manager" or "Password Repository" or "PassKeeper" or "PasswordRegistry"
